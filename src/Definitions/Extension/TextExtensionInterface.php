     * @param int $min Minimum number of characters the text should contain
     * @param int $max Maximum number of characters the text should contain
     * @param int $indexSize  Determines how many words are considered for the generation of the next word.
     *                        The minimum is 1, and it produces a higher level of randomness, although the
     *                        generated text usually doesn't make sense. Higher index sizes (up to 5)
